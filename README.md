This repository contains materials to replicate the quantitative analysis in my article published in Mediterranean Politics:

Abus, Murat. 2023. "A Theory of Gender's Effect on Vote Shift with a Test Based on Turkish Elections." Mediterranean Politics. [DOI](https:://doi.org/10.1080/13629395.2023.2194154)

The files 
```
tur_polbnda_adm2.zip
abus_incongruity_dataset.dta
abus_medit_politics.do
```
may be used to replicate the analysis in the article.

The files
```
tur_polbnda_adm1.zip
abus_gender_province_do
abus_gender_province.dta
```
may be used to generate the province level choropleth maps in the larger supplementary information file.

In addition to the dataset and the Stata code, this repository also includes the larger supplementary information file (a shorter online appendix is provided with the print version of the article).

Note: These materials are also deposited at Harvard Dataverse for long-term preservation.
